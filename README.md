Guftaar is a first-of-its-kind English language m-Health web application catering to PWS (people
who stutter), connecting them with speech therapists and also providing virtual multi-feature treatment support. 

Support for PWS, especially for developing countries, is limited. We aim to tackle
this problem in the context of Pakistan, where lack of awareness, stigmatization and
discrimination, and lack of speech therapy centers is prevalent. Additionally, the limited available support is quoted to be expensive and laborious. To make matters worse, Pakistan has a significant portion of population that suffer from speech impediments. For more details for project scope and references, please refer to the [project proposal](https://github.com/saadsheralam/Guftaar/blob/main/documentation/proposal.pdf).

This project was a collective effort of a team of 6 members, and was completed in partial fulfilment of the requirements for CS 360: Software Engineering project at LUMS. Our project received the best evaluation.
